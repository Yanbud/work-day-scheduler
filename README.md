# work-day-scheduler
## Description
This is a daily planner application. Users can use it to creat schedules. There are a few timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock is colored. Grey means past. Red means present. Green means future. In addtion, Users can add an event and save it for each hour of the day.  
I used the Moment.js library to work with date and time. I used Bootstrap and Jquery to develop the application as well.
